    <Cell><Data Type="String">Quest for the Quarantine follows our protagonist, 16-year-old Esperanza, as she navigates post-apocalyptic Mexico in hopes of reaching salvation in the form of the &quot;Quarantine Zone&quot;. As we follow Esperanza through her journey, we discover that the most pressing danger is the loss of humanity itself... Welcome to Quest for the Quarantine! Throughout this playable story you, the player, can enter commands to help Esperanza navigate both her paths and decisions. Commands must be in the form of “verb noun”. To begin the game, enter “start game” in the text box below. May you guide Esperanza safely to the Quarantine.</Data></Cell>

    <Cell><Data Type="String">Mexico City</Data></Cell>
    <Cell StyleID="s18"><Data Type="String">In the weeks following The Event,&#160;the days were unsafe. She had learned that lesson the hard way with the death of Mama. They took refuge in the night, and for months everything was okay. They even met others who had not succumbed, who were not Violent. They shared stories of past lives, better lives, and hope for salvation. Rumors of a safe zone in the United States, just outside San Diego, persisted among survivors. For a time, they had hope. But slowly, the survivors disappeared, Mama included; so she decided to leave,&#160;to seek out the refuge of the quarantine in the States. She slipped quietly into the night and made her way through the streets of Mexico City, careful to avoid others. As she approaches the main avenue, she notices a small store along the road heading out of the city. Perhaps I should look for supplies? She ponders. Or is it better to just leave the city?</Data></Cell>

    <Cell StyleID="s19"><Data Type="String">The sign above the door reads “Construcentro”. Esperanza steps through the shadowed doorframe and is immediately hit with the smell of mildew. She gazes around the dark store- and notes it’s pretty barren. To her right along the wall is an old storage crate and behind the counter is an unopened delivery box. Outside, some distant shouting appears to grow stronger. If she’s going to grab something, she should be quick.</Data></Cell>

    <Cell><Data Type="String">Outside Leon</Data></Cell>
    <Cell StyleID="s19"><Data Type="String">It has been nearly two weeks since Esperanza has departed Mexico City. After roughly 500 km of hiking, her feet hurt, and she is beginning to run low on supplies. On the twelfth day of her journey, she crests a ridge and spots a city in the valley below. Judging by the nearby highway sign, it’s the city of Leon. There’s people there, potentially dangerous people. On one hand, she needs to make a supply run, but on the other she really likes being alive. She could possibly give the city a wide berth, ignoring it completely, but only if she has enough water in her backpack.</Data></Cell>

    <Cell><Data Type="String">Leon</Data></Cell>
    <Cell StyleID="s19"><Data Type="String">The sun has now fully disappeared behind the horizon as she makes her way into Leon. Old, decrepit cars accentuate the crumbling roadways. There are definite signs of habitation however, as she notes some uncorroded ammunition shells at the entry of an alleyway. She pauses to look back and reconsider her decision, but decides to continue forward. An hour later she enters a small square. She gazes around the square and notes a couple potential looting points: an apartment across the square with a shattered second-story window and a fire escape, and a small bodega below. Or she could continue farther down the road.</Data></Cell>

    <Cell><Data Type="String">Leon: Apartment</Data></Cell>
    <Cell StyleID="s19"><Data Type="String">Once inside the apartment, Esperanza immediately regrets her decision. A violent smell assaults her nose…something is dead in here. With her senses heightened, Esperanza peers down the hallway and notices two doors: one open and one closed. It’s evident the smell is coming from the closed door, but with a quick glance the other room appears to be a bedroom. With her back to the closed door, the hair on her neck begins to stand. She notices a faint creaking coming from the closed room. Between the smell and the adrenaline, she considers escaping the apartment as fast as possible. But there may be treasure to be had within the bedroom.</Data></Cell>

    <Cell><Data Type="String">Leon: Bodega</Data></Cell>
    <Cell StyleID="s19"><Data Type="String">The bodega is dimly lit, and it appears to Esperanza that she is far from being the first person to scavenge in here. Empty bottles and wrappers layer the floor. Few things remain untouched. She picks her way around the discarded remnants for a while, but it proves unfruitful. A distant sound, possibly human, cause her to bolt upright, eyes wide. She cocks her head and listens for a while but notices no other sounds. As she makes her way to the doorway, she notices a small cabinet with closed doors behind the counter. It’s low to the ground and otherwise hidden at eye level.</Data></Cell>

    <Cell><Data Type="String">Leon: Alleyway</Data></Cell>
    <Cell StyleID="s19"><Data Type="String">As she leaves the city, she feels that someone is watching her. She searches the shadows. Nothing. She hears glass bottles rolling on concrete. Time slows down. She can hear footsteps in pursuit. She sprints- ducking around corners. Later in a dark alley she pauses. Can she use something as a distraction? She thinks she can make a run for it maybe, but it might help to divert their attention.</Data></Cell>

    <Cell StyleID="s19"><Data Type="String">A week later, Esperanza finds herself trudging along a dirt road. Since Leon, she had played it safe and avoided any large settlements. As she comes around a bend in the road, she notices a small farmstead to her right. The remnants of a fenced pasture dot the roadside. At the end of a path is a wooden chair with an elderly man. He nods to Esperanza as she approaches, and she regards him cautiously. The farmer attempts to initiate a barter. He wants  ammo and he’s offering the contents of a medium-sized sack he has laying on the ground next to his chair.</Data></Cell>

    <Cell StyleID="s19"><Data Type="String">As Esperanza’s odyssey continues, the mountains in the distance continue to grow larger. She knows the time is getting near for her to traverse the range and reach the western side. As she reaches the foothills, a small village lies in her path. At first observation, it seems completely abandoned. This might be her last chance to get supplies before she summits, but it isn’t devoid of risk. She would need water if she were going to go around the town.</Data></Cell>
